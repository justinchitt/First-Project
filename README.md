## What is Weeb Warriors II
Weeb Warriors II is a game that allows you to select a character and map. After selecting a map, you can have the two characters selected battle with both sides having a %50 chance of winning. Another feature of this game is the ability to add a new character. Our application does not have any complicated controls, all that is needed is to click a few buttons. Our application was create with Javascript, html and css. We used Visual Studio Code to write our text.

## How to run our application:
For our application to work, a json server must be run. Open the HTML file by inputting "explorer.exe index.html" for windows users in the terminal, for ios users input "open index.html". After opening the HTML file to your browser, make sure in the terminal you run "json-server --watch db.json" and refresh the page.

## What motivated us to build the game and why
At first, our intention was to have a website where you can vote for your favorite anime character that would meet the requirements of the Phase 1 project. After some deliberating with ourselves, we decided to scratch that idea and create a more complex project. We wanted to add more than the required interactivity requirments and to create a game that anybody could use.

## What problem does it solve:
Our game solves the problem for the need of entertainment. Also, the game can be used for more than just playing a game. For example, instead of uploading a new character, someone can upload 2 restaurants. Whichever restaurant wins, that would be where they would have dinner at night. 

## What did we learn:
We learned that creating an application in a few days does not have to be perfect, as long as there is full functionality, it is fine. Also, we learned to pay attention to our code and make sure to run many test to ensure everything works the way we want it to. Lastly, we learned to format our code in the beginning so we would not have to deal with a bunch of refactoring in the end. 

## Some of our challnges:
1. Debugging 
2. Scoping Issues
3. CSS Formatting

## Features we hope to be implemented:
1. Updated Combated System
2. Updated Healthbar System
3. Transformations of Characters 
4. Additionally Characters (Will be added in a later DLC)
5. Additionally Maps (Will be added in a later DLC)
